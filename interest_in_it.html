        <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
        <p> IT has always interested me as it is an ever changing and evolving field with countless uses. I have been infatuated with IT since I was about 10 years old when I built my first computer by following a video tutorial on YouTube. What drew me to IT was videogames and all different components of the IT field come together to create an immersive gaming experience for the user. I chose to come to RMIT as I had researched the best possible online universities and I was pointed straight in the direction of RMIT for its reputation in the IT and computer science field.</p>
