        <p>Job Advertisement: Business Analyst:  
          <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39920202?type=standout&searchrequesttoken=b19e596b-6f7a-49cb-98ee-3c26c4e3afc6">Seek Business Analyst</a>
          <p><img src="business_analyst.jpg" alt="Seek Business Analyst Job"></p>

          <p>The position advertised seeks an experience business analyst to ensure all requirements are met prior to a large application integration. This job appeals to me as I had to do an assignment in year 12 where I went into a finance focussed business and analysed the efficiency of their current system and made suggestions on how to improve it.</p>
          <p>This position requires applicants to have previously worked as a business analyst within a banking or financial services setting, to have a holistic knowledge of how to analyse business processes, to have experience in an agile environment, have a strong understanding of financial services, and how the systems used within financial services are used.</p>
          <p>Currently I have very little skills relating to the ones required in this application. I would say that I have a small knowledge of what an agile environment it and that I have a small knowledge of the business processes and suggesting improvements and problem solving.</p>
