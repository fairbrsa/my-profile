        <h1>Project Idea</h1>
          <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This project will involve the creation of an app that allows users to take pictures of taxis, buses, planes and any mode of transportation that they are using when they are travelling overseas and are not sure of the legitimacy or character of the person that they are being driven by. This app will also allow users to share their travels with groups of people such as family members or friends so that any given time, there is a log of the users activities and pictures of transport vehicles that they have gotten in to. This will provide a way for families and friends to have a chronological history of the movement of their loved ones, should anything go wrong and they need help in finding them.</p>
          <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>Hundreds of millions of people use transport services such as taxis and ubers to get from point a to point b. When someone is in an unfamiliar place, such as when they are travelling, it can be stressful and worrying that you have taken the wrong option or are going to be exploited or harmed in some way, as after all when you get into a taxi or an uber you have no idea who the person is driving or if they are out to take advantage of you. Therefore, there is a need for this kind of app, a constant travel log with pictures of vehicles that are being used.</p>
          <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This app will allow travellers from all over the world to feel safe and confident when access private or public methods of transportation. Users will be able to take a picture of the transport service they are using, whether that be the number plate of a car, licence of the driver, or both, annotate it with dates, times, which routes they are taking, and upload it to there own personal gallery. The user can then invite people to join their gallery group so that all members of that group can view what is inside the gallery. Members of the group will be able to download any picture (including all annotations and comments) they would like. For example, if something has gone wrong and members of the group havenâ€™t heard from the gallery owner in a long period of time, they are able to access the galley and search for the latest upload by the user, then send this information to the relevant authorities as an aid for them in searching for the missing user. All over the world, people unknowingly employ the service of what they think is a legitimate transportation service when it is a scam. These people are then blackmailed into handing over money or even worse kidnapped and abused for ransom. Often is the case that the perpetrators are never caught as they flee before and solid information can be documented. The annotated pictures uploaded by the user before getting into the taxi provide an accurate and chronological history of the users travel, allowing authorities the chance to jump on the case quickly and waste no time in tracing the footsteps of user. This in turn provides the user with that extra security knowing that if something goes wrong, no time will be wasted in rescuing them from what ever situation they may be in, whether they have been dropped off in an unknown location and are completely lost, or if they have been taken and their lives are in serious danger.</p>
          <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Relevant mobile devices for testing.</li>
                <li>A computer for programming.</li>
                <li>Strong internet connection for video chatting team members.</li>
              </ul>  
            This project will require a large amount of file hosting servers as the primary use of this application is the uploading of images and videos. An intelligent and effective compression software will need to be used in order to reduce the amount of space required for the files being uploaded. </p>
          <h2>Skills Required</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Advanced knowledge and fluency in programming both android and apple applications.</li>
                  <li>Ability to work in a team at the same time as working self directed.</li>
                  <li>Knowledge of cloud-based computing</li>
                </ul>  
             Software that needs to be written includes an entire application that is able to host all functions of the app that have been outlined. There will need to be quite a large amount of hardware for storing the data of users as they will be uploading multiple images and videos, all with annotations. These skills will be relatively easy to find. Just searching on seek.com.au shows thousands of job applications for programmers and software developers. </p>
          <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>If the project is successful then the application will be completed on both android and apple platforms function at full efficiency with zero downtime. The original problem will be solved as there will now be a way for travellers to upload pictures of transport vehicles that they are entering, allowing members of there group to use these pictures should something go wrong and the relevant authorities require these pictures as a part of an investigation. The impact of this application development and launch will be huge in assisting with missing persons cases, kidnappings etc. Authorities will now have more data of the last known locations of the missing persons, aiding in there investigations as to what has happened and where to go next in terms of directions to follow up.</p>
